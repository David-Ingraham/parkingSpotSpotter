as of 4/22, the geocoding af the users address string is giving diff results from my json dict, 
thrwoing off the distance calculations. 

will try to get lat lng data str8 front front end 

in front end i can grab usrs loc and print to screen lat lng. 
i can hardcode that address with the three dots above the phone
need to inlcude code to send the lat lng to api instead of just printing it 

backdne code needs to change. i will no longer have to geocode the 
addy as it come in, i will already have the lats and longs.

in the get nearby cam fucniotn i wont have to call geocode, i can just 
pass in the http put req from the cleint into the haversine against
all the coords in my cam json. then good. then issuewith the bitnap decodign 
allllll over again.
